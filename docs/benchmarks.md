# Benchmarks

All numbers: i7-1255U (2P+8E), 16 GB, Windows 11, MSVC 19.44 Release (`msvc-release`),
laptop on AC power, unless stated otherwise. Units are ns/op unless stated.

## Phase 0 — foundation primitives (`bench_foundation`)

| benchmark | mean | p50 | p90 | p95 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `now_ns()` | 25.7 | 18.9 | 37.9 | 42.6 | 80.5 |
| `LOG_DEBUG` (disabled) | 0.32 | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.40 |
| `Result<int>` ok path | 0.59 | 0.60 | 0.60 | 0.70 | 1.00 |

Takeaways:
- Timestamps (QueryPerformanceCounter) cost about 20–40 ns. That's negligible per token
  (tokens take milliseconds), but per-op timing inside kernels would be too costly, so
  kernel profiling must be sampled or compiled out.
- Disabled debug logs cost almost nothing, so debug logging can stay in scheduler code.
- The error type's OK path costs almost nothing (DD-002).

## Phase 1 — tensor/dtype (`bench_tensor`)

| benchmark | mean | p50 | p90 | p95 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fp16→fp32 ×4096 (scalar) | 6019 | 5130 | 8310 | 9990 | 13360 |
| fp32→fp16 ×4096 (scalar) | 7208 | 6650 | 8080 | 8910 | 12980 |
| bf16→fp32 ×4096 | 593 | 580 | 640 | 640 | 720 |
| host_alloc+free 4 KiB | 48 | 46 | 51 | 54 | 91 |
| host_alloc+free 1 MiB | 7211 | 6918 | 8590 | 9534 | 12784 |
| TensorView select+slice | 83 | 77 | 96 | 125 | 222 |

Takeaways:
- Scalar fp16 costs 1.25 ns/elem. F16C (Phase 17) should make it about 10× faster.
  Until then, hot paths should avoid converting fp16 per element.
- 1 MiB allocations cost about 7 µs, with a long tail. This confirms that per-token or
  per-step buffers must come from preallocated arenas and pools, never `host_alloc`.
- Building a view costs 77 ns. That's fine at graph-build time; kernels index directly.
