# Design decisions

Format: Decision / Reason / Alternatives / Tradeoffs / Evidence.

## DD-001: C++20, CMake + Ninja, MSVC primary on Windows

- **Decision:** C++20. CMake ≥ 3.24 with presets. MSVC Build Tools 2022 is the
  Windows compiler; gcc/clang on Linux.
- **Reason:** The dev machine had no toolchain. MSVC is the host compiler nvcc
  requires on Windows (future CUDA), and it supports ASAN. C++20 gives
  `std::format`, `std::span`, concepts, and `starts_with` with no extra dependencies.
- **Alternatives:** LLVM-MinGW (clang, portable), C++23 (`std::expected`).
- **Tradeoffs:** MSVC has no UBSAN/TSAN, so those run under the Linux presets.
  C++23 support is still uneven across compilers.
- **Evidence:** n/a (toolchain choice).

## DD-002: Status/Result instead of exceptions for errors

- **Decision:** Fallible functions return `Status` or `Result<T>`. `ENGINE_RETURN_IF_ERROR`
  and `ENGINE_ASSIGN_OR_RETURN` propagate errors.
- **Reason:** Failure paths stay visible at subsystem boundaries. A bad request
  can't unwind through the scheduler. The OK path costs nothing: no allocation,
  just an empty string.
- **Alternatives:** exceptions; `std::expected` (C++23).
- **Tradeoffs:** More boilerplate than exceptions. `std::bad_alloc` from the STL can
  still throw; the memory manager will turn large allocation failures into
  `kOutOfMemory`.
- **Evidence:** `bench_foundation` "Result<int> ok path" (see docs/benchmarks.md).

## DD-003: Runtime ISA dispatch, no global arch flags

- **Decision:** Build a portable baseline. SIMD kernels get per-file arch flags.
  The best tier is chosen once at startup from cpuid + XCR0.
- **Reason:** One binary runs on every x86-64 CPU and still uses AVX2/AVX-512
  where present. Checking XCR0 avoids faults when the OS disabled a register state.
- **Alternatives:** `-march=native` builds; separate binaries per ISA.
- **Tradeoffs:** The kernel entry costs one indirect call (a function pointer set
  at startup). Per-file flags need care so inline functions from headers don't
  spread AVX2 code into generic TUs. Rule: SIMD code lives only in `.cpp`
  files under `backends/cpu/<isa>/`.
- **Evidence:** n/a until Phase 17 kernels exist.

## DD-004: Hybrid-core awareness from day one

- **Decision:** Detection reports P-cores and E-cores separately (Windows
  `EfficiencyClass`, Linux `cpu_core`/`cpu_atom` PMUs).
- **Reason:** On hybrid CPUs such as the i7-1255U (2P+8E), a barrier-synchronized
  GEMM runs at the pace of the slowest worker. AUTO thread selection needs this
  information to avoid putting heavy work on E-cores.
- **Alternatives:** use `hardware_concurrency()` only.
- **Tradeoffs:** Platform-specific code in `platform/`. It stays isolated there.
- **Evidence:** To be measured in Phase 6/17 (threads = P-cores vs. all cores).

## DD-005: GoogleTest via pinned FetchContent

- **Decision:** Use a system GTest if present, otherwise download v1.15.2 with a
  pinned SHA256.
- **Reason:** A standard, well-known framework. Pinning the hash makes builds
  reproducible.
- **Tradeoffs:** The first configure needs network access, or a pre-installed GTest.
